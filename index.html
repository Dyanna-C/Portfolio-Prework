                    <h3> How I got here</h3>
                    <strong><small> A combination of curiority, frustration and wanting more</small></strong>
                    <p>I thrive when I am challenged which is one of the things that led me to Coding temple. I found myself becoming bored with my career opportunities. It seemed that the more I advanced in my career the less I liked the work I was doing. I started interviewing for more roles in my field and was constantly asked about my programming experience. I was disappointed to share that I did not have much. I have seen code but I am truly a beginner. I love problem solving and puzzles. I do my best when I am constantly learning. All these factors led me to consider a bootcamp program.

                        After I complete my training at Coding Temple I hope to secure a role that allows me to use my cross training as a biomedical scientist and a programmer to develop products and programs that support the care of those with Genetic Differences. I also aspire to use my expertise to develop tools which help train he next generation of scientists, researchers and health care providers.

                    <p> Boredom is painful for me and it is common for me to have multiple projects going on at the same time. When I am trying to relax I enjoy knitting and crocheting. Currently I am working on a blanket made from giant yarn

                    <p>I love live music. My favorite genres include Rock, Funk, Neo soul, Dance pop, Alternative r&b, Contemporary classical and Afrofuturism. It’s common for me to play a song I like repeatedly for days on ends despite how annoying it is to my loved ones ( this is why they invented headphones) .Spotify Wrapped named my tops artist of 2021 as Miguel, Usher, Summer Walker, Jasmine Sullivan and WIllow Smith. I’m confident that Usher will beat Chris Brown in a vs. battle anyday. When I get a job offer after bootcamp. I plan to celebrate by purchasing tickets for Ushers Vegas Residency Show.

                I love learning about holistic health and wellness. In the last year I have lost 40lbs while still eating ice cream and enjoying real food. I’ve also been able to beat some health challanges without medication or extreme measures. I am
